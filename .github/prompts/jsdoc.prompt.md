For the given TypeScript function, generate a JSDoc block that:

Describes only the purpose of the function in one sentence (no examples, no extra description).

Lists each @param with a short description of its role.

Expands object destructured parameters (like options) into @param options.<prop> entries.

Adds an @returns tag describing the return value.

Use concise technical wording.
Output only the updated code with the JSDoc above the function.
